                <p><a href="https://navient.com" target="_blank">Navient</a> consumer complaints have surged again in January 2025. Navient Solutions was one of the nation’s largest federal student loan servicers. However, since 2017, they have been receiving a growing number of lawsuits. They were banned from providing student loan services in September 2024.</p>

                <p> According to <a href="https://www.studentloanplanner.com/navient-lawsuit-updates/" target="_blank">StudentLoanPlanner.com</a> in January 2017 the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov" target="_blank">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)</a> filed a lawsuit against Navient. They were accused of failing to act in their consumers’ best interest. This included: failing to apply student loans to accounts correctly, misreporting loans to the credit bureaus, and failing to inform borrowers of IDR plan renewal deadlines. </p>

                <p>In the graph below, you will see three of the 39 states that joined in the original settlement listed. The consumer complaints surged again in January 2025. Each state has seen this same surge. These complaints fall under the money transfer or money service category. This could be from the aftermath of CFPB actions.</p>
